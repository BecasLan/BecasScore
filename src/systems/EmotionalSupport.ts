Look for:
- Suicidal ideation
- Self-harm mentions
- Severe depression
- Hopelessness
- Cry for help

This is SERIOUS. Be accurate.

Respond with:

- type: "depression" | "anxiety" | "suicidal" | "self_harm" | "none"
- confidence: 0-1
- suggestedResponse: supportive message for user
- shouldAlertMods: boolean (true for high/critical)`;
